# Lab 1 - GTKWave and GHDL
## Engineering-Design-VI CPE-322
## Written by Jacqueline Castro

In this lab, we will be utilizing GTKWave, GHDL, and Notepad++. GTKWave is used to be able to visualize data, 
both analog and digital, as well as facilitate various search operations and allow users to save certain signals 
that are extracted from a complete simulation dump. GHDL is described as an open-source simulator for the VHDL 
language. It also compiles and executes VHDL code in a computer.  Notepad++ is a free source code editor that allows 
a user to use various languages. The goal of this lab is to explore the capabilities of GTKWave, GHDL, and Notepad++ 
by creating and testing a simple half adder code.
